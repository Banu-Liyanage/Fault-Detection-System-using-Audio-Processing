## 🛠 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Audio recording device
- (Optional) CUDA-compatible GPU for faster model training

### Setup

#### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-fault-detection.git
      cd smart-fault-detection

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
bashCopypip install -r requirements.txt
### 3️⃣ Configure settings
bashCopycp config/settings.example.yaml config/settings.yaml
# Edit settings.yaml with your configuration
🎤 Data Collection
The system works with pre-recorded audio or can collect samples in real-time:

Store raw audio files in data/raw/
Processed features are saved to data/processed/
Sample rate: 44.1kHz (configurable in settings)
Recommended clip length: 3-5 seconds

## 🚀 Usage
1️⃣ Record Audio
Record a short audio clip of a machine in operation:
bashCopypython src/record_audio.py
2️⃣ Extract Features
Convert the audio into useful numerical features:
bashCopypython src/feature_extraction.py
3️⃣ Train the Machine Learning Model
Train an AI model to classify normal and faulty machine states:
bashCopypython src/train_model.py
4️⃣ Predict Faults
Run the trained model to classify a new sound sample:
bashCopypython src/predict_fault.py --input test_audio.wav
5️⃣ Real-time Fault Detection via API (Optional)
Run the Flask or FastAPI backend to detect faults remotely:
bashCopypython app/main.py
Then access the API at http://localhost:5000/predict
## 🧪 Testing
To ensure everything is working correctly, run:
bashCopypytest tests/
## 📈 Model Training Pipeline

Data Collection – Collect audio from different machine states
Preprocessing – Normalize and clean the data
Feature Extraction – Compute MFCCs, Spectrograms, etc.
Training – Train a model (e.g., Random Forest, CNN, or LSTM)
Evaluation – Test accuracy & optimize hyperparameters
Deployment – Deploy as a local or cloud-based API
