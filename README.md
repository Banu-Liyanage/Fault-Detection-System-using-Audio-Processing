# Fault-Detection-System-using-Audio-Processing
This project uses machine learning &amp; sound analysis to detect faults in machines by analyzing their acoustic signatures. The system records, processes, and classifies sounds to identify anomalies.
## 🔥 Features
- **📢 Real-time sound recording**
- **📊 Feature extraction** (MFCCs, Spectrograms, Zero-Crossing Rate, etc.)
- **🤖 AI-powered fault classification**
- **⚡ Real-time fault detection API**
- **📈 Jupyter notebooks for data exploration & model training**
- **🛠 Easily configurable via YAML settings**

## 🛠 Installation
 ###1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-fault-detection.git
   cd smart-fault-detection
##2️⃣ Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
🎤 Data Collection
Store raw audio files in data/raw/
Processed features are saved in data/processed/
The dataset can be pre-collected machine sound samples or recorded in real-time.
🚀 Usage
1️⃣ Record Audio
Record a short audio clip of a machine in operation.

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/record_audio.py
2️⃣ Extract Features
Convert the audio into useful numerical features.

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/feature_extraction.py
3️⃣ Train the Machine Learning Model
Train an AI model to classify normal and faulty machine states.

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/train_model.py
4️⃣ Predict Faults
Run the trained model to classify a new sound sample.

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/predict_fault.py --input test_audio.wav
5️⃣ Real-time Fault Detection via API (Optional)
Run the Flask or FastAPI backend to detect faults remotely.

bash
Copy
Edit
python app/main.py
Then access the API at http://localhost:5000/predict.

🧪 Testing
To ensure everything is working correctly, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest tests/
📈 Model Training Pipeline
Data Collection – Collect audio from different machine states.
Preprocessing – Normalize and clean the data.
Feature Extraction – Compute MFCCs, Spectrograms, etc.
Training – Train a model (e.g., Random Forest, CNN, or LSTM).
Evaluation – Test accuracy & optimize hyperparameters.
Deployment – Deploy as a local or cloud-based API.
🏗 Future Improvements
🔥 Use Deep Learning models (CNN, LSTMs) for better accuracy
🌎 Integrate with IoT devices for real-time fault detection
📊 Develop a web-based dashboard for visualization
⚙️ Optimize for embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, ESP32)
